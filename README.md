# Transfer Learning with MobileNet

This project was completed as a part of the Honors portion of the [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks) Course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).

## Objective


In this project, I will leverage transfer learning with MobileNetV2, a pre-trained model designed for fast and efficient performance. By the end of the assignment, I will be able to create a dataset, preprocess and augment the data, adapt the pre-trained model, and fine-tune the classifier's final layers to improve accuracy. The objective is to build an Alpaca/Not Alpaca classifier, benefiting from the cost-effective customization of the pre-trained model.
